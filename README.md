# Network Failure Prediction System

A Linux-based network health monitoring system that predicts network degradation
before failures occur using active probing, adaptive baselines, and risk scoring.

## 🚀 Features
- Active network probing (latency, jitter, packet loss, timeouts)
- Environment-agnostic design (works in WSL, cloud, servers)
- Self-learning baseline (no hardcoded thresholds)
- Explainable network risk score (0–100)
- Automated execution using cron
- Alerting with audit logs

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Collector probes network quality using ping
2. System learns normal behavior over time
3. Latest metrics are compared against baseline
4. A weighted risk score is calculated
5. Alerts are triggered for medium/high risk

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Linux
- Python 3
- SQLite
- Cron

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [x] Active probing and metric collection
- [x] Adaptive baseline learning
- [x] Risk scoring engine
- [x] Automated execution with cron
- [ ] Email / Slack alert integration
- [ ] Web dashboard for visualization
- [ ] Cloud deployment (AWS EC2)


## 🧠 Design Decisions

- Used active probing instead of NIC/TCP counters to remain compatible with restricted and virtualized environments.
- Avoided hardcoded thresholds by implementing adaptive baseline learning.
- Used explainable risk scoring instead of binary alerts to reduce false positives.
- Designed system to run fully headless using cron, suitable for servers and cloud VMs.
